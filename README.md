# Resume.gpt

Resume.gpt is an AI-powered resume analyzer designed for efficient and unbiased hiring processes. Developed by myself and my team, this project was the top10 finalist at INNOV8 hackathon hosted by eightfold.ai and ARIES (Artificial Intelligence Society IIT Delhi).

## Overview

Resume.gpt features a Flask-based frontend where users can upload their resumes in PDF format and specify their focus areas of interest. The application processes resumes, highlighting relevant information based on the specified focus areas. Additionally, users can ask questions related to the resume content, and Resume.gpt provides accurate answers extracted from the resumes.

## Key Features

- **Resume Highlighting**: Automatically identifies and highlights relevant text sections based on specified focus areas.
  
- **Question Answering**: Uses advanced AI models like Roberta for precise responses to user queries about resume content.
  
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Employs MixedBread for sentence embedding and Sentence Transformers for cosine similarity-based quantified retrieval, ensuring efficient information extraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with Flask to provide an intuitive user interface for resume submission and interaction.
  
- **AI Models**:
